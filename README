CLI-Startup

Every command-line script does (or should) accept command-line
options, at the very least a --help option, and should allow
default options to be specified in a "resource" file, named by
default $HOME/.SCRIPTNAMErc.

This package accepts a simple hash of command-line options and
uses it to generate command-line processing, a --help message,
and resource-file processing. These are all annoying chores that
every script needs, and that are always essentially identical but
for the specific options supported.
